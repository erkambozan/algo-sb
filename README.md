# Algorithms Spring Boot Application

An implementation of basic algorithms and data structures on a spring boot application.

## Objective

This project is to show the implementation of the basic algorithms / data structures and at the same time using the new techs to build a rest 


## Techs:

Technologies in the project:

- Java 10
- Spring Boot 2
- Spring DevTool (for speeding up the restart, etc)
- Lombok (for avoiding boilerplate code)
- Swagger-ui (for exposing the rest services in a easy/user friendly web page)
- Log4j2 (for logging)
- jUnit (for testing)

To be added:
- Docker (generate docker image, etc)
- Oauth2 (for authentication)

## Algorithms:

Data Structures
- Bag
- Queue (FIFO)
- Stack (LIFO)
- Deque
- Steque

Problems:
- Balanced Parentheses (using stack)
- Binary Representation (using stack)
- Josephus Problem (using queue)


## Running

1) clone the code
2) run AlgorithmsApplication.java class
