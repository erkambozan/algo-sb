# Algorithms Spring Boot Application

An implementation of basic algorithms and data structures on a spring boot application.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to implement few basic algorithms (search, sorting, common problems, etc.) and data structures (queue, stack, etc.) on a Spring Boot / Micro Service / containerized project.

I'm using the book Algorithms, 4th Edition by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne, as a base for the algorithms and data structures.

The idea is to code few of the problems described in the book as spring services, adding some rest controller for testing and execution. I will be using Swagger UI, which will show all the endpoints in a user-friendly way.

All just for playing around with the spring boot micro service world and at same time recall the basis of computing coding.


## Techs:

Technologies in the project:

- Java 10
- Spring Boot 2
- Spring DevTool (for speeding up the development / restart, etc)
- Lombok (for avoiding boilerplate code)
- Swagger-ui (for exposing the rest services in a easy/user friendly web page)
- Log4j2 (for logging)
- jUnit (for testing)

To be added:
- Docker (generate docker image, etc)
- Oauth2 (for authentication)

## Algorithms:

Data Structures
- Bag
- Queue (FIFO)
- Stack (LIFO)
- Deque
- Steque

Problems:
- Balanced Parentheses (using stack)
- Binary Representation (using stack)
- Josephus Problem (using queue)


## Running

1) clone the code
2) run AlgorithmsApplication.java class
