/**
 * Josephus Problem.<br/>
 * Based on: In the Josephus problem from antiquity, N people are in dire straits and agree to the
 * following strategy to reduce the population. They arrange themselves in a circle (at positions
 * numbered from 0 to Nâ€“1) and proceed around the circle, eliminating every Mth person until only
 * one person is left. Legend has it that Josephus figured out where to sit to avoid being
 * eliminated. Write a Queue client Josephus that takes M and N from the command line and prints out
 * the order in which people are eliminated (and thus would show Josephus where to sit in the
 * circle).
